##                                                Hi there 👋


Hi, I’m Nadia Ghanizada, a Computer Science student transferring to Cal State Fullerton with a background in C++, Python, and Java. I’m passionate about building practical, efficient solutions and always looking to level up my skills in AI, machine learning, and software development.

- 🚀 I’ve completed NASA’s NCAS Fellowship, where I served as a Surface Operations Specialist and helped lead mission planning for a simulated lunar rover deployment.
- 👩‍💻 I founded Girls4Code, a program where I teach coding fundamentals to younger girls and help them get a head start in tech.
- 💬 I care about applying tech in meaningful ways, whether that’s optimizing systems, improving user experiences, or working on projects with real-world impact.
